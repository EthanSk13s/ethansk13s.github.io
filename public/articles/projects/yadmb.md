# YADMB (Yet Another Discord Music Bot)
> A Discord Music Bot written in Python to allow both local and streaming playback.

[Repository](https://github.com/EthanSk13s/yadmb)

YADMB is a Discord music bot written in Python using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library. It uses a PostgreSQL
database to manage local music files, and playlists created by users in different servers. Music playback is powered with the use of [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink), and is interfaced with the [Wavelink](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink)* library.

This bot is not hosted publically, and is mostly used for me and my friends' uses. However the code is hosted publically as a repository noted above.

*As of April 5, 2025, Wavelink is not maintained. I may migrate to another client for Lavalink if things stopped working on my end.
