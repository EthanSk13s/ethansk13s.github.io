# Portfolio Site (This site!)
> A simple static site built with Vue, Tailwind CSS, with a custom article information parser.

My portfolio site built with Vue and Tailwind CSS. Before building or deployment, there's a hook that parses through
the articles that takes some information about the Markdown file. For now, it is the name of the article and a short
description.

This site mostly contains my projects, any random articles or blogs that I felt like writing.
